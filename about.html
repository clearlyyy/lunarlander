                LunarLander is still being updated and worked on, this means some features may not work correctly, or in unintended ways.
                Many features are still actively being worked on. Here is some targets i'm aiming at for a full release.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Functional Course Editor (Allow users to build and share courses)
              </p>
              <p>
                - Leaderboards for high-scores on official courses.
              </p>
              <p>

          <h1 style="color: #DFDFDF">Open Source!</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2rem">LunarLander.io is completely open-source and free. This means you can look at the source code, modify it and do whatever you want locally.
             I Intend to keep it that way, if you have any suggestions for features of the game you'd like put into the main branch, prove the feature doesn't break functionality, write tests, and make a pull request!</p>

            I'm Clearly. Im a developer based in Canada interested in 3D Graphics and game development, aswell as free-software.
            LunarLander is a hobby project to learn more about ThreeJS and simulating big scenes on the browser. The project was started in September 2025,
            and continues to be worked on whenever i have free time. Thanks for playing!
