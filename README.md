[LunarLander.io](https://lunarlander.io) is a online browser-based lunar flight simulator that puts you in the cockpit of the Apollo 11 lunar module on a 1/4th scale version of our moon. Players navigate challenging obstacle courses while experiencing realistic Newtonian physics, and can experiment with the Moon's gravity and the spacecraft's thrust.

You can try it live at [LunarLander.io](https://lunarlander.io) or run it locally.
